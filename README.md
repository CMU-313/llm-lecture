# Tic-Tac-Toe React App

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React. Players can take turns placing "X" and "O" on the 3x3 grid until a player wins or the game ends in a draw. The game also includes a "Restart" button to clear the board and start a new game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/torqueJY32/tic-tac-toe-react.git`

2. Change to the project directory:

`cd tic-tac-toe-react`

3. Install dependencies:

`npm install`

4. Start the development server:

`npm start`

The app will now be running at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Game Rules

1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns placing their symbol ("X" or "O") in an empty square.
3. The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If the grid is full and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
5. The "Restart" button clears the board and starts a new game.
