# Tic Tac Toe React App

This repository only contains this Readme. Your task is to implement the core features using generative AI tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot to assist you in every aspect of the process.

# TO-DO
- [ ] Implement the **Core Features**
- [ ] **Write tests** Write unit tests for your components and functions using a testing library (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library). Ensure that your tests cover edge cases and provide adequate code coverage.
- [ ] **Write documentation** Document your code, including component descriptions, function explanations, and usage instructions. This will help future developers understand and maintain the codebase.
- [ ] **Push Commits**
- [ ] **Make a Pull Request**
- [ ] Implement the **Stretch Features**

# Core Features to Implement
**Disclaimer** You are required to attempt to implement each feature, but there is no guarantee that ChatGPT / Copilot can assist you with it.

1. Display game board: Create a 3x3 game board using a combination of React components and CSS styling. Each cell of the game board should be clickable.

2. Player turns: Implement alternating turns for two players, X and O. Show an indicator (e.g., text or visual cue) to inform the current player whose turn it is.

3. Handle player moves: When a player clicks on an empty cell, mark it with their respective symbol (X or O). Prevent a player from overwriting an occupied cell.

4. Check for win condition: After each move, check if there's a winning combination (3 in a row, column, or diagonal) on the board. If a player wins, display a congratulatory message and highlight the winning combination.

5. Check for draw: If there are no empty cells remaining and no player has won, declare the game as a draw and display an appropriate message.

6. Reset game: Provide a button to reset the game, clearing the game board and resetting the turn indicator.
