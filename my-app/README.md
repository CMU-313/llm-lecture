# Overview
The Tic Tac Toe app is a simple game where two players take turns placing X's and O's on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all the spaces on the grid are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
Technologies Used

The Tic Tac Toe app was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We used the React library to build the user interface and manage the game state.

# File Structure
Here is the file structure for the Tic Tac Toe app:
tic-tac-toe/

public/index.html: The HTML file that renders the React app.
public/favicon.ico: The favicon for the app.
src/App.js: The main React component that renders the game board and manages the game state.
src/Square.js: A React component that represents an individual square on the game board.
src/App.css and src/index.css: CSS files for styling the app.
src/index.js: The entry point for the app.

# Running the App
To run the Tic Tac Toe app, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Then, follow these steps:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd tic-tac-toe
Install the dependencies: npm install
Start the development server: npm start
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to play the game.

# Game Play
To play the game, simply click on one of the squares on the game board to place your symbol (either X or O). The game will automatically switch turns between the two players, and will end when one player wins or when all the squares are filled without a winner.

# Conclusion
The Tic Tac Toe app is a simple but fun game that demonstrates the power of React and the ease of building web applications with modern web technologies. I hope this documentation helps you understand how the app works and how you can run it on your own computer.
